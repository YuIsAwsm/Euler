"""

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

Q: In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?

âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
=>
-- 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
-- 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
=>
3/2 ; 7/5 ; 17/12 ; 41/29
=> so we getting from sequence this formulae 
=> n(k+1) = n(k) + 2d(k) and 
   d(k+1) = n(k) + d(k), where n is the numerator, d is the denominator
